    "## Preamble: Predicting competitor airfares on new routes\n",
    "\n",
    "Air carriers regularly update their destination network and a necessary condition for adding a new flight connection to the existing network is that flights on this route are profitable. In addition to costs, profitability is determined by the price at which competitors could cater to the demand for flight transportation between two locations. A data-driven way of determining this would be on the basis of a supervised learning algorithm that has been trained on the fares for existing flight connections and which leverages information about route-specific characteristics. The dataset that we are using in this lab contains such information for more than 600 flight connections between different American cities. More specifically, we have information on the number of required stops, the market concentration on a particular route, Holiday destination status and a number of other characteristics that are detailed on [p.7 in the `mlba` library documentation](https://github.com/gedeck/mlba/blob/main/mlba_2.0.0.pdf). In the following, we will train and tune different supervised learning models that predict the average fare for a flight.\n",
